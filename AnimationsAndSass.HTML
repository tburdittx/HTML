        <h1>CSS Testing</h1>
        <p> This is the second page of the website. Here I will be testing out different CSS functions and seeing what can be achieved. </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            A gradient background can be achieved using by applying the linear-gradient tag to the background within the body selector.
            This then applies the background to all of the content in the body section.
        </p>

        <button onclick="ShowHide()">Click Me!</button>

        <p id="Hidden">
            A switch statement can be used to show or hide content on a web page. These are helpful if something only needs to be shown if certains conditions are met.
            The most common way to activate a switch is by having a button to show or hide it.
            Javascript is needed to help give the switch functionality and the conditions that need to be met for cntent to be shown or hidden.

    <p id="textbox">
        A text box can be useful on a website becuase it will help to get the reader's attention quicker than other parts of the page.
        A textbox can also be animated to add some excitement and fun to a page, or to highlight something that could be easily overlook by the viewer.
    </p>
    <div id="SASS">
        <p>
            SASS is a tool which can be very helpful to cosmeic website development. It allows you to use variables either on the website as a whole or
            just in particular sections (within div selectors). By adding in this function, it then means that you can delcare the variable at the top
            of the document and then place the variable name where applicable within the code. This can only be done in a .scss file, which then gets
            converted to a .css file so the computer is able to understand and then format correctly. A SASS file will look the same as a CSS file until
            variables are included, as the only major changes made are when the value of the variable are inserted directly into the appropiate locations.
